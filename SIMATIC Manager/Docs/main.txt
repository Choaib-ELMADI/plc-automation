1. Introduction:
    => The creation of a plant or a machine is typically a project that comprizes 4 phases:
        * Planning and Configuring
        * Implementation and Module Test
        * Testing and Commissioning
        * Operation and Maintenance

    => The SIMATIC software supports you in all the phases of the project.

2. SIMATIC Manager:
    => SIMATIC Manager integrates, in one place, all the tools you need while developing your project. Tools like:
        * Hardware Configuration
        * Network Configuration
        * Symbol Processing
        * Test Functions
        * Archiving
        * Program Generation "Controller": LAD, FBD, STL __ S7-SCL __ S7-GRAPH
        * Operating and Monitoring Systems "HMI": e.g WinCC flexible
        * Runtime Software: e.g PID Control
        * Data Management throughout the Configuration

    => All the objects handled by the SIMATIC Manager have an equivalent in the real objects of the plant.

3. Project Development:
    => Planning and Configuring:
        -> Creating a project with station
        -> Setting up the hardware (setup addresses, ...)
        -> Configuring the connections

    => Implementation and Module Test:
        -> Create the symbols (inputs, outputs, memory, ...)
        -> Develop the control program
        -> Program test module by module
        -> Configure the visualization

    => Testing and Commissioning:
        -> Load the program
        -> Test in regular operation
        -> Archiving and backup

    => Operation and Maintenance
        -> Teleservice

4. Creating a Project:
    => Symbols in the English version:
        - Input: I
        - Output: Q
        - Memory: M

    => Symbols in the French version:
        - Input: E
        - Output: A
        - Memory: M

    => The MOVE instruction in OB100 is used to set initial values or reset variables when the PLC starts running.

    => Connect SIMATIC Manager with FluidSim via EzOPC:
        - In SIMATIC Manager:
            * Start a simulation and select a communication protocol
            * Select your PLC station and Download it

        - FluidSim:
            * Click Options
            * Select EasyPort\OPC\DDE Connection...
            * Select OPC mode
            * Configure the FluidSim Out modules
            * Start (Run)
